## dotradelabs

dotradelabs is the core contributor behind dotrade. It's a team of security researchers, developers, and quant chads who have contributed to your major blockchains, DeFi protocols, and perp/option exchanges. The team used to perform security audits, risk analysis, and run delta-neutral vaults and arbitrage vaults for individuals.

## Our Mission

It was disappointing to see that even after all this development, the community still isn't getting proper trading and hedging opportunities or risk-free neutral vaults - stuck between chain, dexes, bridges with fragmented liquidity. We're trying to tackle some of these problems by creating products the community actually wants to use.

We're fascinated by **"You name it, we have it."** So if there is an efficient existing solution we will integrate it, if not we will create one.
