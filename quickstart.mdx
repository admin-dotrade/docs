## Step 1: Initialize Your Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Bot">
    Search for [@dotrade_bot](https://t.me/dotrade_bot) on Telegram or click the link to open it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the Bot">
    Send the `/start` command to initialize your account.
    
    ```
    /start
    ```
    
    The bot will create a non-custodial Privy wallet for you and provide your wallet address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Your Wallet Address">
    Copy and save the wallet address provided. You'll need this to deposit funds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure Your Exchange

Choose your preferred exchange for trading:

```
/setexchange hyperliquid
```

<Note>
  Currently, Hyperliquid is fully supported. Extended, Lighter, and Polymarket integrations are coming soon.
</Note>

## Step 3: Set Referral Code (Optional)

If you have a referral code, set it now to get fee discounts:

```
/setreferrer YOUR_CODE
```

<Warning>
  You can only set a referral code once, so make sure you have the correct code before using this command.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Deposit Funds

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send USDC">
    Send USDC to your wallet address from any compatible wallet or exchange.
    
    Supported networks:
    - Arbitrum (recommended)
    - Ethereum Mainnet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Confirmation">
    Wait for the blockchain transaction to confirm. This usually takes a few minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Balance">
    Verify your deposit with:
    
    ```
    /balances
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Bridge to Exchange

Bridge your USDC to your selected exchange:

```
/bridge 100
```

This will bridge $100 USDC to your exchange account. Adjust the amount as needed.

<Note>
  There's a small bridge fee to cover transaction costs. The fee will be displayed before you confirm.

## Pro Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Trailing Stops">
    Protect your profits with trailing stop losses that automatically adjust as the price moves in your favor:
    
    ```
    /trailingsl ETH 5
    ```
    
    This sets a 5% trailing stop loss on your ETH position.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Your Positions">
    Regularly check your positions and balances:
    
    ```
    /positions
    /balances
    /openorders
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start Small">
    If you're new to trading, start with smaller position sizes to get familiar with the platform and commands.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Risk Management">
    Always use stop losses and take profits to manage your risk:
    
    ```
    /sl ETH 2800
    /tp ETH 3200
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Risk Warning

<Warning>
  Trading perpetual futures involves significant risk of loss. The high leverage available can work against you as well as for you. Only trade with capital you can afford to lose, and always use proper risk management.
