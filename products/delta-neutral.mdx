title: "Delta Neutral Vaults"
description: "Automated yield generation through funding rate arbitrage"
---

## Overview

An automated yield generation strategy that exploits funding rate arbitrage between Hyperliquid perpetuals and spot holdings. The dotrade engine manages delta-neutral portfolios to capture funding payments while minimizing directional exposure.

## What is Basis Trading?

Basis trading, also known as cash-and-carry arbitrage, involves simultaneously holding:

1. **Spot position** - Long position in the underlying asset
2. **Perpetual position** - Short position in the perpetual contract

This creates a **delta-neutral** portfolio that earns funding rates without directional market exposure.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Opportunity">
    The dotrade engine continuously monitors funding rates across Hyperliquid perpetuals to identify profitable opportunities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Positions">
    When funding rates are favorable, the vault simultaneously:
    - Buys the spot asset
    - Opens an equal-sized short perpetual position
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Funding">
    As long as the funding rate is positive, short positions receive funding payments from long positions every 8 hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Risk">
    The engine continuously monitors and rebalances positions to maintain delta neutrality and manage risks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exit & Compound">
    Profits are collected and either distributed or compounded back into the strategy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Risks to Consider

<Warning>
  While delta-neutral strategies minimize directional risk, they are not risk-free:
</Warning>

- **Funding rate reversal** - Rates can turn negative, requiring payment instead of collection
- **Execution risk** - Slippage and timing differences when entering/exiting positions
- **Liquidation risk** - Extreme volatility could affect position management
- **Smart contract risk** - Risks inherent in DeFi protocols and smart contracts
